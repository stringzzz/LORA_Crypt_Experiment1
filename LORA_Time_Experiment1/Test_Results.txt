LORA_Crypt Time Test Experiment 1

The LORA locker directory was set up with the username "LORA_TimeTest" using
'LORA_Registration.php', password was "5000"
The "Crypt_File" was setup with 2^20 bytes (1MB)

The following is that setup on the terminal:

New Username: LORA_TimeTest
New username valid.
New password: 5000
Confirm the new password: 5000
New password valid.
LORA_TimeTest_locker directory created.
LORA_TimeTest_file.LORA file successfully created.
LORA_TimeTest_file.HASH file successfully created.
New username account creation complete.

A script 'Password_Hash_TimeTest.php'was setup to log the time it would take to generate strings from "0"
to "5000", md5 hashing each one and comparing it with the md5 hash of the original "5000".
The following are the results of this brute force attack:

Password_Hash_TimeTest:
Start time	1684114897
End time:	1684114897
Total Time elapsed: 0 seconds

The time was so short that with this level of precision, it appeared to be zero.

Then, the 'LORA_Crypt_TimeTest.php' script was set up to generate every string from "0"
to "5000", md5 hashing it and attempting to decrypt the 'LORA_TimeTest_locker/LORA_TimeTest_file.LORA' file. 
The resulting candidate plaintext was then md5 hashed and compared with the hash 
in 'LORA_TimeTest_locker/LORA_TimeTest_file.HASH'. Here are the results of the brute force attack on the LORA_Crypt system:

Username: LORA_TimeTest
LORA_Crypt_TimeTest:
Start time	1684249908
End time:	1684249949
Total Time elapsed: 41

Clearly it takes several times longer to brute force this system. It takes almost no time to log 
into the system with the correct password, so this seems to be an ideal situation.
At a glance, this system seems to be a vast improvement over the typical password hash login 
system, as even with all information aside from the password, attacking the LORA_Crypt system 
would take much longer, possibly too time-consuming to make it worth attacking in this way. 
Of course, there could be other attacks that are effective against this system, but at this time I am not sure how to approach that.
